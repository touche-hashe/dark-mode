# Dark/Light Mode Toggle

A simple web project built with _HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_ that allows users to switch between light and dark mode.  
The selected mode is saved using _localStorage_, so it stays the same even after reloading the page.

## Features

- Light/Dark mode toggle button.
- Saves user preference in localStorage.
- Styled boxes and text that adapt to the chosen mode.



When clicking the button:

- _Light Mode_: White background, dark text.
- _Dark Mode_: Dark background, white text.
